# PacMan
I made a PacMan game for a school project using only javascript, css and html without any adittional libraries used only plain js. 
There are some bugs left i don't think i will ever finish it but it's playable for now, open index file using Firefox.
Pretty cool project in my opinion given that i started it without knowing anything about js.
Code may seem complex and bad righten but there are a lot of comments and i will be adding a power-point soon.
If you run the game make sure you have the Pac-Man Images file where index.html is located, the Pac-Man Images is the zip file.

## Here is the intro animation with the menu. Only start button works for now.

## Here is how gameplay works. Pac-man isn't actually moving at all, but all the other elements are!.

## Here is a preview of how the ghosts get eaten and they go back to prison. It actually shouldn't go throught collision but still pretty good i think.

## Conculsion.
  The code is pretty messy and bad written i know and there are some bugs than need to get fixed, but i don't have the time to finish it so it's probably never gonna change :(.
I have a lot of other school ascingment at the moments and this one is good enough for me to pass the project so there is no point to fail in my other projects for this.
I really enjoyed working on this, it took one month of detication learning, making the same mistakes over and over, getting frustrated but it was pretty fun! Javascript is an
interesting language for sure! Except for a clean code and bug fixes i would also want to add more power ups, nerfs, voice commands, click commands, light-shadow vision, more interesting ghost pathing (AI? maybe), a highscore system and an Android Mobile version.
